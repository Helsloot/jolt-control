# Jolt Control
This repository contains the control software for  Delmic's Jolt system.

## Getting Started
Customers of Delmic will receive executables for windows 7, 8 and 10. If you want to run the software from source, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
Install python3 on your computer and add the following packages with pip: 
`pyinstaller, wxpython, appdirs, decorator, pyserial, timeout_decorator, click`

### Running from Source
You can run the software from source on both linux and windows. Add the `src/` folder to your pythonpath and run the main program:

`python3 src/jolt/gui/jolt_app.py` to start the main GUI
`python3 src/jolt/fwupd/jolt_fwupd.py` to start the firmware updater GUI

### Configuration file
You can modify or extend the configuration file and add threshold ('saferange') and 'target' values, as presented in the following example.
The configuration file, named `jolt.ini`, is stored in the `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Delmic\Jolt\`.

The code takes care of updating the target and saferange values based on the user input. In case the configuration file is not extended
or invalid inputs are inserted, the code updates the variables with some default values. An example of an extended configuration file follows.

   [DEFAULT]
   voltage = 0.0
   gain = 0.0
   offset = 0.0
   channel = R

   [TARGET]
   mppc_temp = -10

   [SAFERANGE]
   mppc_temp_rel = (-1, 1)
   heatsink_temp = (-20, 40)
   mppc_current = (-5000, 5000)
   vacuum_pressure = (0, 50)

Note that the SAFERANGE variables are tuples of integers and they represent the lower and upper threshold value of the corresponding feature.
The mppc_temp_rel corresponds to the mppc temperature range, relative to the target temperature, in Â°C.
Note that an integer value should be given for the TARGET mppc temperature.

### Building Windows Executables
Navigate to the `install/windows` folder and run the build_jolt batch file. A terminal will open which allow you to select between building the main GUI and the firmware updater. Pyinstaller will create a `dist/` folder which will contain the executable.

## Developer Information
More information for Delmic software developers can be found in the `doc/` folder. For compiling the pdf install texlive, navigate to the folder in a terminal and type `pdflatex developer-doc.tex`.
